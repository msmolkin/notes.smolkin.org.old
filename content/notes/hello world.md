2023-07-25 12:50 pm	Creating my first file inside Hugo-based Quartz

2023-07-25 15:15 pm	It's now ready for publication

2023-07-25 15:40 pm	In theory, I should update the languages to include Russian and English and Hebrew and French (and update the corresponding titles)
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/
https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages
In practice, I'll probably never get around to adding any languages other than English, and *that's okay*.

Wow that's awsome:

```goat
      .               .                .               .--- 1          .-- 1     / 1
     / \              |                |           .---+            .-+         +
    /   \         .---+---.         .--+--.        |   '--- 2      |   '-- 2   / \ 2
   +     +        |       |        |       |    ---+            ---+          +
  / \   / \     .-+-.   .-+-.     .+.     .+.      |   .--- 3      |   .-- 3   \ / 3
 /   \ /   \    |   |   |   |    |   |   |   |     '---+            '-+         +
 1   2 3   4    1   2   3   4    1   2   3   4         '--- 4          '-- 4     \ 4

```

Oh, that's even cooler:
````text
Hi
```json
{
"a" : "b"
}
```
`cd ..`
``echo "Hey, what's up?"``
```python
print("Wow, you can make text blocks that cover inner code blocks.")
```
````
