Remember that thing you bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?tag=smolk-20) last month?
That *AMAZING DEAL* you got? The lightning deal? The firesale?

Well, unless you were buying an Amazon camera, chances are you got ripped off. You can find nearly all the products on sale today for less than you paid.

e.g. I paid for a THKAILAR flash drive for $27â€¦ apparently, today, I could have gotten a SanDisk Duo Go version with the same capacity (I presume the speed is at least comparable) and smaller form factor (important for USB Type-C) for $22.
