It's back, you can save your GPT playground results again (albeit, this time, without their built-in presets).

In the spirit of archiving everything and preserving history, while I won't share my presets yet, here are the defaults that I have saved from when I last played with them:

Links that no longer show up (beta.openai.com now redirects to platform.openai.com):
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-summarize
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-grammar
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-explain-code?model=gpt-4
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-explain-code?model=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-explain-code
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-chat?lang=python
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-chat?lang=node.js
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-chat

Ones I didn't know about:
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-vr-fitness
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-spreadsheet-gen

From this [YC comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34374154):
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-chat?model=text-davinci-003
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-friend-chat?model=text-davinci-003
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-marv-sarcastic-chat?model=text-davinci-003

Ones people have shared that I pulled off of the first page of Google and haven't checked myself yet:
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/Aw889I2krC4mdmwcPhgZhjgC?model=text-davinci-002
https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/JuRZ4Cn6MG3FLmyEf96C0Zp3

I could use Bing Chat to generate this list myself.
Prompt: "Please generate a list of 20 popular URLs that you find on the internet that begin with https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/" and see if there exist 20 old default ones (when it was called beta)
Prompt: Please generate a list of 100 popular URLs that you find on the internet that begin with https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/" and get a bunch that people have shared publicly

#todo I still want to write that launchd (or just a crontab if that'll be faster) that will commit and push every day to save update my blog
