That's really quite smart the way they decided to roll out GPT access to the word. First, release a platform better than anything the world has seen so far. Generate PR naturally, probably by befriending influential New York Times and Time magazine and Wired authors. and showing it to them. Then, charge a nominal fee to speed up processing and give access to a system that’s even smarter… but with limited use of the smarter GPT-4 system—25 messages per three hours per $20/mo account—which has since been increased to 50 messages per three hours as of yesterday. If they want to, they can increase the cost to use GPT-4 with fewer restrictions.
And, of course, if you want privacy or a higher context window, you can pay for the API.
