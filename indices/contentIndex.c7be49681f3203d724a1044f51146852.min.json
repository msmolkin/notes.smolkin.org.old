Prompted me to finally start this public blog. I'd publish everything on here, but my writing has thoughts that, well, shouldn't be public. Any interactions that could be questionable were always positive interactions from all parties. But my thoughts were not.\n\n10:59am -07:00 (1690307982634)\nRight now, this isn't what anyone is saying, but this is my (hot) take:\nPeople are saying turning Twitter into X is a mistake. I disagree. If I remember right, X.Com was the original name of PayPal, so Musk has a connection to it. Model X and SpaceX are testaments to the same (yes, I know the consumer cars Tesla released spell out SX3Y, an anagram for sexy, but I stand by my conviction that the letter X has a special meaning to the man).\n@elonmusk Musk overpaid for Twitter. The issue for him, the reason that he kept talking about the number of bots and the overplayed, exaggerated bot statistics, was that he was just paying too much for this website. His \"cost per click\"/\"cost per mille\"/cost per consumer was far higher than it should have been. He was buying the company just for their network and their worldwide reach. (of course, their near-instantaneous infrastructure was also good, but it wasn't the most important thing, because he can always hire engineers to replace their infrastructure). The same reason JP Morgan bought Frank.\nBut he's doing everything right. He gets a network, then he links it to X. Eventually, his hope is that X becomes a world-wide payment system, where you think about a car and a Tesla drives up to you and gets you to your destination, and the payment is handled in the background. The idea is there. With my background in neuroscience, I'd like to be on the Neuralink side of things, but I hope that my application will be by manual introduction.","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.646961432Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26":{"title":"2023-07-26 Creating a simple transcription/translation script with AWS","content":"\n### aws file transcription\n\nTL;DR: Still not finished. This tells you how to take an audio file, upload it to AWS (assuming you've already created a bucket, either with something like `aws s3 mb recordings` or manually via the website), create a user account (they call it an \"IAM User\") with the necessary permissions, transcribe the file, and then manually submit a batch job to translate it. Translating via terminal/programmatically is a headache that I still haven't figured out. It involves temporary permissions (they call them \"IAM Roles\"), instead of just giving the user account permission. That's all that's remaining for this to be a complete tutorial to automate permissions.\n\nBonus! I also included a [[2023-07-26 GPT prompt]]\n\n##### Create user to do transcriptions\nRun the following commands in the cloud console (or on your machine which already has access to the AWS CLI. Since I didn't want to bother with downloading and configuring the CLI, I chose the cloud console). To access the console Go to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users` -\u003e and click on the console button, which looks like this: \u003ca class=\"globalNav-0291 globalNav-029 globalNav-0210 _icon-color_izqbm_6\" href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1\" title=\"CloudShell\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" id=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-testid=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-tools-experience-ingress-point=\"cloudshell-icon-header\"\u003e\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"2.0\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"globalNav-0216\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 5l2.997 2.998L5 11m4.997-.002H12m3-7.626A2.374 2.374 0 0012.627 1H3.37A2.372 2.372 0 001 3.372v9.256a2.373 2.373 0 002.37 2.373h9.257A2.375 2.375 0 0015 12.628V3.372z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-miterlimit=\"1.5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" fill=\"none\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n1. `aws iam create-user --user-name TranscribeUser`\n2. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`\n3. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonTranscribeFullAccess`\n4. `aws iam create-access-key --user-name TranscribeUser` [^1]\n5. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess` (figured it out by running ~~```export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`TranslateFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)```~~ `aws iam list-policies` from AWS's [how-to page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-iam-policy.html) and searching through the results)\n\n##### Upload files and run transcription command\n6. Then figure out how to upload the files from my Mac to the S3 bucket programmatically. For now, uploaded manually by opening the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/upload/recordings.smolkin.org?region=us-west-1)\n\t1. I set this up on EC2 and did this just a couple days ago with the log files, so it can't be too hard to set up on my Mac\n\t2. Here's the command I'll run: `aws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` \n7. When using the AWS CLI, you'll need to handle special characters, such as spaces, by enclosing the S3 URL in double quotes to prevent parsing errors. Well, you should escape the spaces in the S3 URL using backslashes or enclose it in double quotes, if there's an error.[^2] \n8. Transcribe the recordings (can be run inside cloud console as well). \n\t1. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get GPT-3.5 to generate the command properly for me.[^2] FINALLY! The issue was how `--media` was supposed to be handled: `--media MediaFileUri=s3://{bucket_name}/path/to/file`\n\t2. Update: it's best to put these inside a separate folder that contains nothing from previous days, as all files in this directory will be used when generating the translation. So don't use `recordings.smokin.org/results`, rather use `recordings.smolkin.org/results/transcriptions/{today's date}`\n```\n# Transcribe New Recording 8.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 8.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n# Transcribe New Recording 9.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 9.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n```\n\n##### Retrieve completed transcriptions\n9. List all transcription jobs in your AWS account, including their status, and you can check if the new job with your specified job name has completed successfully: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs`\n\t1. You can also run it with the specific job name: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews']\"`\n10. Once the transcription job is completed (i.e. `TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=={JobName}][\"TranscriptionJobStatus\"] == \"COMPLETED\"`, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results: `aws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --output json`\n11. This part is much better to do once you have that IAM access working (otherwise, accessing files is a huge pain with AWS S3): The transcription results are stored in the S3 bucket and folder/object specified by the `OutputBucketName` and `OutputKey` parameters when the job was created. You can use the `cp` command to copy the transcription file from S3 to the local computer/server: `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews.json ./`, `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia.json ./`\n12. Create a transitional text file that will be used for the automated translation. Also, this is the result of the transcription. Hooray!\n\n11:\n```sh\nfor file in *.json; do\n    jobName=$(jq -r '.jobName' \"$file\")\n    jobDetails=$(aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='${jobName}']\")\n    languageCode=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].LanguageCode')\n    completionTime=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].CompletionTime')\n    fileNameDate=$(date -d \"$completionTime\" +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')\n    fileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_transcript.txt\"\n    jq -r '.results.transcripts[0].transcript' \"$file\" \u003e \"$fileName\"\n\t\n\t# en and en-US both work\n    # aws translate start-text-translation-job --input-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$file\" --output-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$outputFileName\" --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::021741100599:role/TranslateFullAccess --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-codes en-US # Error: first couldn't create IAM keys and get arn to work\n\t# translatedFileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_translated.txt\"; aws translate translate-text --text \"$(cat \"$fileName\")\" --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-code en --output text \u003e \"$translatedFileName\" # Error: An error occurred (TextSizeLimitExceededException) when calling the TranslateText operation: Input text size exceeds limit. Max length of request text allowed is 10000 bytes while in this request the text size is 41011 bytes\n    # for file in *_transcript.txt; do transcribedText=$(cat \"$file\"); translatedText=$(aws translate translate-text --text \"$transcribedText\" --source-language-code $languageCode --target-language-code en); echo \"$translatedText\" \u003e \"${file%.txt}_en.txt\"; done # never checked this one\ndone\n```\n\n[^3]\n13. Send the file(s) to AWS Translate [Synchronous, O(n^2) solution (moved to the bottom of the document, because it has too many flaws)]. This can actually be done without step 11. Step 11 can be replaced with just two more calls to the API.\n\n##### Translate transcriptions and download files\n14. (Optional: AWS CloudShell Directions) If this was done in the AWS CloudShell, download all resulting files to the desktop. This step should be unnecessary, once all permissions have been configured and it's done completely in the cloud\n\t1. Go to the directory (probably `~`) where you saved all your requests. `cd; ls`. Copy the output of `ls`\n\t2. In the upper right corner of the CloudShell, click 'Actions \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cpath class=\"filled stroke-linejoin-round\" d=\"M4 5h8l-4 6-4-6z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e -\u003e Download file' ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 10.09.53 AM.png]]\n\t3. Sequentially, paste the path to each file and press Download\n15. Manual:\n\t1. If doing just a couple files, I can manually do the translations. After completing step 14, go to `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#translation` and upload the file there\n\t2. Or I can manually run the batches:\n\t\t1. Copy the files back to the folder from which you'll be calling them: `aws s3 cp BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia_ru-RU_2023-07-26_06-04-30_transcript.txt s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`\n\t\t\t1. ⚠️ don't forget the `/` at the end of the folder name! otherwise, s3 will actually copy your file to a new file with the same name as the directory, e.g. creating a new file called \"s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions\"\n\t\t\t2. the output folder creates a directory for this job. the input folder uses all files in the input. so you need to separate files in this job from files in other jobs, probably by using a subdirectory. this is relevant when making the output of the transcription, so you don't have to move the file once it gets to this point\n\t\t2. https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#create-batch-translation\n\t\t3.  Just ran the AWS translation using the website. I should've done this from the start. They still don't give me a CLI command to do this automatically, but they were willing to generate an AWS Translate IAM role for me that works (although IDK how to use it outside of manually using the AWS translation batch)\n\t\t4.  To retrieve the data:\n\t\t\t1.  Open the job: https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#batch-details/126ac04db7b95bb1bb0f03b541d19cb8\n\t\t\t2.  Then click on \"Output file location\" ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 11.15.59 AM.png]]\n\t\t\t3.  And then get to the file data and click \"Open\" or \"Download\"\n[^1]: Note down the response. This is the info you'll need to use this account. It is only shown once. I used to do this manually using their website, so you can do that if you want. It's actually surprisingly intuitive. Or you can just use these commands, which I've already gathered, to do the same thing.\n```json\n{\n    \"AccessKey\": {\n        \"UserName\": \"TranscribeUser\",\n        \"AccessKeyId\": \"[the access key is here]\",\n        \"Status\": \"Active\",\n        \"SecretAccessKey\": \"[the key secret is here]\",\n        \"CreateDate\": \"2023-07-26T00:40:31+00:00\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n[^2]:  So back to Google it is. But it did give me a good starting point with which to search. ~~The final google string that found me what I needed: google \"aws transcribe command example\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/index.html\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/start-transcription-job.html\" or not~~. I guess I keep trekking. google \"Error parsing parameter '--media': Expected: '=', received: 'EOF' for input:\" -\u003e https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cli-error-parsing-parameter-expected-receved-eof [doesn't apply to me] or https://www.roelpeters.be/solve-error-parsing-parameter-expectedreceived-eof-for-input-aws-cli/. I'm sure these'll help someone, but they don't help me. google \"aws cli transcribe expected =\" -\u003e https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/getting-started-cli.html FINALLY!

Here are the steps you need to take to generate a new IAM key and use it to transcribe audio files stored on your computer via an S3 bucket:\n\n1. **Create an IAM User**:\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.\n   - Click on \"Users\" in the left-hand navigation pane and then click on \"Add user.\"\n   - Provide a name for the user, select \"Programmatic access\" as the access type, and click \"Next.\"\n   - Choose \"Attach existing policies directly\" and search for the \"AmazonTranscribeFullAccess\" policy. This policy grants the necessary permissions for transcribing audio files using Amazon Transcribe service.\n   - Click \"Next\" to review the user details, and then click \"Create user.\"\n   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that will be displayed on the next screen securely. These credentials will be used for programmatic access to AWS services.\n\n2. **Install AWS CLI**:\n   - If you don't have AWS CLI installed on your computer, download and install it from the AWS website: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n   - After installation, run `aws configure` on your computer and provide the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format. This will set up your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.\n\n3. **Prepare Audio Files**:\n   - Ensure that the audio files you want to transcribe are stored on your computer in a location you can easily access.\n\n4. **Upload Audio Files to S3**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to upload the audio files to your S3 bucket. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/audio/file` with the actual path of your audio file on your computer, and `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` with the S3 URL of your bucket and the desired path inside the bucket where you want to store the audio file.\n\n5. **Transcribe Audio Files**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to transcribe the audio files using Amazon Transcribe. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --language-code en-US --media MediaFileUri --output-bucket your-output-bucket\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with a unique name for your transcription job, `en-US` with the appropriate language code for your audio files (e.g., `en-US` for English), `MediaFileUri` with the S3 URI of the audio file you uploaded (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/your-audio-file.wav`), and `your-output-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want the transcription results to be stored.\n\n6. **Retrieve Transcription Results**:\n   - Once the transcription job is completed, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --output json\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with the name of your transcription job. The output will be in JSON format, containing the transcribed text and other relevant details.\n\nThat's it! You have now generated a new IAM key, used it to upload audio files to your S3 bucket, and initiated the transcription of those audio files using Amazon Transcribe.","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.646961432Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2023-07-26-fixing-config-error":{"title":"2023-07-26","content":"2:14pm -07:00 (1690406083618)\nPretty cool.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.650961531Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/docker":{"title":"Hosting with Docker","content":"\nIf you want to host Quartz on a machine without using a webpage hosting service, it may be easier to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the instructions below than to [install Quartz's dependencies manually](notes/preview%20changes.md).\n## Hosting Quartz Locally\nYou can serve Quartz locally at `http://localhost:1313` with the following script, replacing `/path/to/quartz` with the \nactual path to your Quartz folder.\n\ndocker-compose.yml\n```\nservices:\n  quartz-hugo:\n    image: ghcr.io/jackyzha0/quartz:hugo\n    container_name: quartz-hugo\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/quartz:/quartz\n    ports:\n      - 1313:1313\n\n    # optional\n    environment:\n      - HUGO_BIND=0.0.0.0\n      - HUGO_BASEURL=http://localhost\n      - HUGO_PORT=1313\n      - HUGO_APPENDPORT=true\n      - HUGO_LIVERELOADPORT=-1\n```\n\nThen run with: `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.\n\nWhile the container is running, you can update the `quartz` fork with: `docker exec -it quartz-hugo make update`.\n\n## Exposing Your Container to the Internet\n\n### To Your Public IP Address with Port Forwarding (insecure)\n\nAssuming you are already familiar with [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) and [setting it up with your router model](https://portforward.com):\n\n1. You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik). Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.650961531Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/editing":{"title":"Editing Content in Quartz","content":"\n## Editing \nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.658961729Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.658961729Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"[api key]\" # blocked it out for Zhang's pivacy\n  operandIndexId: \"[index id]\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T09:46:12.658961729Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
